                    <p class="font-small font-21">As human beings, we often find ourselves feeling out of place in the world around us. We sense that something is not quite right, that the reality we experience is not necessarily the truth. And yet, we are bound by the beliefs and illusions that have been ingrained in us since childhood.
                        It can be a difficult and confusing journey to try and unravel these beliefs, to see beyond the layers of deception that cloud our vision. We may feel as though we need to make an effort, to strive for enlightenment, to grasp at something just beyond our reach.
                        But what if the answer is not found in effort, but in surrender? What if we simply allow ourselves to be carried by the flow of existence, to trust in the natural rhythm of life itself?
